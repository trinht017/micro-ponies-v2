A web application built during CUHackIt2023 with friends. 24-hour non-stop coding, no sleep
Our goal was to build a platform to connect Clemson Students and help them find housing.

Inspiration: Co-op students and out of state students have trouble finding subleasing during the summer because they are usually found through forums and discord post which are not frequently updated.

What it does: 
Allows users to view listings, post their own listings including images, delete their own listings, see account info, log in, log out, see individual listings

How we built it:
Built with React/Tailwindcss frontend, express server backend, AWS S3 for image hosting, MongoDB Atlas for hosting DB, AWS Beanstalk for hosting express server, Netlify for hosting react frontend, Auth0 for authentication and authorization, Postman for api testing, Git for version control.

unicorn-express is our backend nodejs rest api
unicorn-housing is our frontend react application
